NFC Spoolman Middleware — Beta (Spool Cache)
============================================
Beta version of spoolsense.py testing in-memory spool cache to avoid
fetching all spools from Spoolman on every NFC scan.

Changes from production:
  - In-memory UID → spool cache with TTL-based refresh (default 5 minutes)
  - Cache miss triggers a forced refresh before giving up
  - requests.Session() reuses TCP connections to both Spoolman and Moonraker
  - _normalize_uid() centralizes UID sanitization

If this tests well, promote to middleware/spoolsense.py.

Flow:
  ESP32-S3 scans NFC tag
    → publishes UID to MQTT topic nfc/toolhead/T0 (or T1, T2, T3)
      → this script receives the message
        → looks up UID in cache (refreshes if stale or empty)
          → sets active spool in Moonraker
            → updates Klipper toolhead macro variable
              → Fluidd displays correct spool per toolhead
