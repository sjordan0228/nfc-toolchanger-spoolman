Ideas for writing updates on filament usage to a OpenPrintTag

The Write Logic 
Function to be triggered 60 seconds after a filament unload is detected.

def write_usage_to_tag(lane_id, spool_id):
    """Fetch current usage from Spoolman and write to NFC tag."""
    try:
        # 1. Get the latest 'consumed_weight' from Spoolman
        resp = requests.get(f"{SPOOLMAN_URL}/api/v1/spool/{spool_id}")
        if resp.status_code == 200:
            spool = resp.json()
            usage = spool.get("consumed_weight", 0)
            
            # 2. Determine which reader handles this lane
            reader_id = "reader1" if lane_id in [1, 2] else "reader2"
            
            # 3. Construct the OpenPrintTag payload
            # Key 0 is standard for 'consumed_weight' in many OpenPrintTag implementations
            payload = {0: round(usage, 2)}
            hex_data = encode_openprinttag(payload)
            
            if hex_data:
                # 4. Publish to the ESPHome write topic
                topic = f"nfc/{reader_id}/write"
                client.publish(topic, hex_data)
                logging.info(f"Wrote {usage}g to tag on Lane {lane_id} via {reader_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to write usage to tag: {e}")


CBOR Encoding
Uses the cbor2 library to convert the Python dictionary into the compact binary format required by OpenPrintTag.

def encode_openprinttag(data_dict):
    """Encode dictionary to CBOR hex string."""
    try:
        # Convert dict to CBOR binary, then to hex string for MQTT transit
        encoded = cbor2.dumps(data_dict)
        return encoded.hex()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"CBOR Encode Error: {e}")
        return None

ESP32
On the ESP32 side (the YAML I provide), the reader listens for that nfc/readerX/write topic and executes this lambda to perform the physical write:

on_message:
  - topic: nfc/reader1/write
    then:
      - lambda: |-
          // Converts the hex string back to bytes and writes to the tag's NDEF area
          std::vector<uint8_t> data = hex_to_bytes(x);
          id(reader1).write_ndef(data);

Possible Problems I forsee (spooky tone)
Using one pn5180 to read two lanes I am certain there will be times when it tries to write updates but the scanner is picking up the wrong nfc tag. 
My idea to correct this is to do the following. Although it may not be worth doing....maybe better to just have a macro that you run manually after an unload to update the tag using a 3rd pn5180.

Targeted Write
Python Side: When the 1-minute timer expires, have the script look up the target_uid that was originally assigned to the lane. Have it send a JSON message containing both that uid and the ndef data.

ESP32 Side: The ESP32 parses the JSON and checks if the target_uid is actually present in the reader's field. If it finds a match, it performs the write. If not (e.g., the tag was swapped during the 60-second window), 
it aborts the write and logs a warning. 

I have already thought about how to handle the mismatches when loading new filaments because this same exact issue will come up:
If a mismatch occurs during Loading:
If Tag Usage > Spoolman Usage: The spool was likely used elsewhere. Update Spoolman to match the tag
If Tag Usage < Spoolman Usage: This is the problem above. Log a warning but stick with Spoolman's higher number and hope we can write the changes to the tag at some point.
