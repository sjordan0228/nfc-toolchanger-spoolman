tag_sync/scanner_writer.py — MQTT interface to openprinttag_scanner.

Publishes write commands to the scanner firmware via MQTT.
Phase 1: fire-and-forget. No response correlation or retries.

Command topic format:
    openprinttag/<deviceId>/cmd/<command>/<uid>

Response topic (not consumed in Phase 1, for future observability):

    Publishes a write command to the openprinttag_scanner firmware.

    Phase 1 behavior:
      - Fire-and-forget: does not wait for or consume cmd/response
      - Failures are logged but never raise — writeback must not block activation
      - One command per call — do not batch

    The scanner firmware handles:
      - UID validation (rejects if tag swapped between command and execution)
      - Write queueing (max 8 pending)
      - remaining_g → consumed_weight conversion
      - Aux-region write with full-write fallback
      - Verification retries
