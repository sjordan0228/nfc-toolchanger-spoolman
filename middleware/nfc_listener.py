NFC Spoolman Middleware
=======================
Listens for NFC tag scans published via MQTT by ESPHome-flashed ESP32-S3 devices.
When a tag is scanned, it looks up the spool in Spoolman by NFC UID, then sets
the active spool in Moonraker so Klipper and Fluidd can track filament usage
per toolhead.

Flow:
  ESP32-S3 scans NFC tag
    → publishes UID to MQTT topic nfc/toolhead/T0 (or T1, T2, T3)
      → this script receives the message
        → looks up UID in Spoolman
          → sets active spool in Moonraker
            → updates Klipper toolhead macro variable
              → Fluidd displays correct spool per toolhead
